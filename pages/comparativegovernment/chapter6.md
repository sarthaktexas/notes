- tldr
  - authoritarian systems do not provide any official mechanism by which the people can hold the government accountable for its actions and policies

## Sources of Authoritarian Rule
- economic factors
  - massive economic inequality can contribute to authoritarianism while a large and broad middle class would undermine authoritarian rule

    - both end in authoritarianism
- social factors
  - **political culture**: norms for people in power
