# Chapter 3: Nations and Society
- tldr
  - people in a society can be united by ethnicity, nation, and citizenship, and the degree to which they are united can shape the legitimacy of the state
  - people in a society can be divided by cleavages and these cleavages can become the basis for political divisions and conflicts over policymaking in the state
  - political attitudes describes how people will call for and respond to changes in the political system
  - political ideology describes what policy goals people want the political system to accomplish
  - major trends of democratization, modernization, and globalization, are shaping the politics and economics of the modern world

- **ethnicity**: "you're one of us"
  - ethnicity is not race
  - ethnicity refers to attributes that distinguish you from others

- **citizenship**: formal relationship between the estate and an individual
  - trade of rights for allegiance
  - citizenship is the basis of patriotism

## Social Cleavages
- cleavages are the basis for political conflict
- Lipset and Rokkan identified 4 most consistent cleavages:
  - **owner vs worker**
    - more pronounced in a "rich vs poor" divide
  - **church vs state**
    - for individuals that don't like religion to influence policymaking
  - **urban vs rural**
    - aka "center vs periphery"
    - refers to when people in the periphery don't like changes in the city and people in the city progressively shape changes in culture
  - **land vs industry**
    - one side is the state's exercise of control over trade and tariffs in order to protect domestic business and workers
    - other side is ruled by large corporations that desire private control and open access to trade
- cleavages can be cross-cutting or coinciding
  - **cross-cutting cleavages**: two cleavages don't align in a way that reinforces the divide between
    - lets say owner vs workers, what if the workers have a church vs state cleavage between them? that's cross-cutting
    - this type allows politics to continue to function with civility and without breaking the society apart
  - **coinciding cleavages**: two cleavages go in completely different directions, whichever side has power changes the policy agenda completely
    - also called reinforcing cleavages which can serve as an example of a **centrifugal force** that divides and polarizes the people of the state or a **centripetal force** that unifies the people of the state
    - these can completely break a society and threaten the unity of a state
- **political attitude**: how people feel about the pace at which political change should occur
  - **radicals**: rapid, dramatic, and revolutionary change; completely dissatisfied with the status quo and believe existing institutions are not suited to make necessary changes and need to be replaced with a new regime
  - **liberals**: want to make progressive changes through evolutionary reforms rather than through rapid revolution; enacts changes using the current regime instead of creating a new one
  - **conservatives**: more satisfied with the status quo than no and view proposed changes to institutions with skepticism and caution; they defend the current regime and feat that changed could be for the worse
- **political ideology**: refers to goals and not pace and methods of change
  - **liberalism**: prioritize economic and personal freedom
  - **communism**: true freedom comes in the form of economic equality
  - **social democracy**: (aka socialists) believe in basic economic equality but without central control (distributive tax and benefit policies)
  - **fascism**: rejects equality and freedom; people can be classified as "superior" or "inferior"
  - **anarchism**: state is bad, abolish the state; cooperation of people in communities is true freedom and equality
- **political culture**: basic norms for political activity in a country
  - **globalization**: movement of tech, information, trade, and environmental concerns
  - **modernization**: transition away from religious and culture tradition and moving toward a set of values based on secular or rational principles that emphasize scientific progress, economic development, and individual rights
  - **democratization**: explosion in the number of democratic political regimes that emerged in the world after the fall of communism
