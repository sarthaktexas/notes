# The Eighteenth Century: An Age of Enlightenment
During the Enlightenment the rationalism of scientific thought was applied to political and economic ideas. Traditional societal and religious ideas were challenged by Voltaire and Diderot, who promoted enlightened despotism and deism, while Locke and Rousseau came up with new political models involving the concepts of natural law and natural rights that challenged absolutism.

### **The Enlightenment**
- Read the introduction to the chapter. What did the term "Enlightenment" mean in the 18th century? Who was Marie Therese de Geoffrin? What role did women play in the Enlightenment?
  - The term "Enlightenment" meant "man's leaving his self-caused immaturity." Marie Therese de Geoffrin was a wife of a wealthy merchant who held discussions on a wide-range of topics.
- How was the Enlightenment, in many ways, an extension of the Scientific Revolution of the previous century or so? What fundamental beliefs carried on throughout both?
  - The Enlightenment was a movement of intellectuals who dared to know. This was similar to the ideas scientists had in the scientific revolution. Both used the word *reason* to advocate their ideas.
- Who was Bernard de Fontanelle? Why was he such a pivotal character of the Enlightenment if he never did any actual experiments or made any new discoveries?
  - He was secretary of the French Royal Academy of Science. He possessed a deep knowledge of all the scientific work of earlier centuries and his own time. He was also able to communicate that body of scientific knowledge in a meaningful way.
- What is skepticism? How was this "New Skepticism" different from the previous century?
  - Skepticism is doubt. New Skepticism is different because of the skepticism towards the church and not science.
- Who was Pierre Bayle? What was his attitude towards religion?
  - Protestant who attacked superstition, religious intolerance, and dogmatism. In his view, compelling people to believe a particular set of religious ideas was wrong.
- How are the ideas of "skepticism" and "cultural relativism" connected? What is "cultural relativism" and why were people thinking about it?
  - The christian perception of god was merely one of many. In James Cook's *Travels*, he writes "every day they see a new religion, new customs, new rites." which made the public further skepticize the church. This is the idea of cultural relativism, culture is defined by the area and is not equal everywhere.
- Spielvogel credits two Englishmen, Isaac Newton and John Locke, for being the most intellectually inspirational pre-Enlightenment thinkers. We already learned about Newton. Who is Locke? What did he write? Why were his ideas new and significant?
  - Locke brought the idea of citizens' rights which was not default in this time period. He believed in right of liberty, justice, and property.
- What is a "philosophe" and what kinds of roles did they play in society? What was the capital of the Enlightenment?
  - Philosophes were literary people, professors, journalists, statesmen, economists, political scientists, and above all, social reformers. They came from nobility and the middle class, and a few from the lower class.
  - Paris was the recognized capital with most of the Enlightement leaders being French.
- How did the philosophe's feel about censorship?
  - Philosophes called for freedom of expression because their work was done with censorship. They were not free to write whatever they chose. They found ways to get around censorship however.
- What were the ideas put forth by Baron de Montesquieu in _The Spirit of the Laws?_ Although he was French, who did he use as a model example of government? Why?
  - Montesquieu called for separation of power (separating the government into judicial, legislative, and executive).
  - He used England as a model example of government because England's constitution was most far-reaching in terms of rights and had a lasting contribution to political thought with an importance on checks and balances created by separation of powers.
- What class was Voltaire from and what line of work brought him early success? Of which elements in French society and government was Voltaire most critical?
  - Voltaire was a middle-class playwright. Voltaire was most critical about religious fanaticism, intolerance, and superstition.
- What was the "Calas Affair" and how did it relate to Voltaire's opinion of the church?
  - Protestant Calas was accused of murdering his own son to stop him from becoming a Catholic. Voltaire's appeals for toleration appeared all the more reasonable.
- What is "Deism"? Are deists atheists or not? Do they believe in God? If so, how are they different than typical Christians?
  - Deism is belief in god but he does not tamper with the universe. They are not atheists.
- Who is Denis Diderot and what is he best known for helping create?
  - Diderot was the son of a skilled craftsman from eastern France who helped make the encyclopedia.
- Spielvogel says that many of the philosophes of the 18th century attempted to uncover "Natural Laws" pertaining to the "Science of Man." What did he mean by this? Were they successful? Why or why not?
  - Natural Laws were the parts of all areas of human life and the science of man were the social sciences. The philosophes arrived at natural laws that they believed governed human actions. Less universal now, but laid the foundation for modern social sciences.
- Who is David Hume? What was his famous work entitled and what did he argue in it?
  - David Hume was a Scottish philosopher who wrote *Treatise on Human Nature* which he argued that observation and reflection, gtrounded in "systematized common sense," made conceivable a "science of man."
- Who are the "Physiocrats" and what did they study? What were the names of some notable physiocrats?
  - The group that believed in natural economic laws that governed society such as land is the source of wealth, supported supply and demand, and created laissez- faire. Opposed mercantilism.
  - Notable Physiocrats included Quesnay and Smith.
- In what respect did physiocrats reject (or repudiate) mercantilist economic beliefs? What did they stress as being different from what mercantilists fundamentally believed? What is "laissez-faire" economics?
  - Physiocrats wanted the existence of natural economic forces of supply/demand to make individuals freer to pursue their own economic self-interest.
  - **Laissez-faire**: hands-off the economy government
- What did Adam Smith write in _The Wealth of Nations_? How was his argument just slightly different than the physiocrats? What is "economic liberalism" and is this term the same as what we view as "liberal" today? Why not?
  - Smith condemned tarriffs in mercantilism as a way to protect home industries. He loved free trade. He did not fully oppose mercantilism but parts of it.
  - **Economic Liberalism**: economic liberty of individual (pertains to just economy whereas "liberal" today is a social/political term)
- How were Paul d'Holbach's views considered rather extreme, or radical, for his time?
  - D'Holbach's views were atheist while most other intellects were deist at the time.
- Why is Marie-Jean de Condorcets's view of humanity both ironic and tragic?
  - Condorcet stated humans went through nine phases and the tenth phase was about humans being perfect. He died later in prison.
- Jean-Jacques Rousseau has to be one of the more complex figures of the Enlightenment. His ideas are at times obscure and contradicting. Do the best you can to describe his views on the following topics: Government, Social Contract, General Will, Individual Freedoms, Education.
  - Government
    - Necessary evil
  - Social Contract
    - Agreement on the part of an entire society to be governed by its general will - if individual wants to follow - self-interest, they should abide by general will
  - General Will
    - community's highest aspirations - what's best for the community; liberty = forcing people to follow what's best for all because that's best for individuals
  - Individual Freedoms
    - adherence to laws one has imposed on oneself - creation of laws â‰  parliament's job because everybody is responsible for framing general will
  - Education
    - should foster rather than restrict children's natural instincts - balance between heart and mind
- How did the Enlightenment, in some ways, reinforce the same old gender values that had been practiced in pre-Enlightenment times?
  - "natural" biological differences (women = destined to be mothers; men = more intellectual than women)
- Who was Mary Astell? What were two major ideas she argued?
  - Astell was the daughter of a wealthy coal merchant who argued women needed to become better educated and equality of the sexes in marriage.
- Who was Mary Wollstonecraft? What did she write? What contradictions did she point out from other male Enlightenment thinkers?
  - English writer who wrote *Vindication of the Rights of Women*
  - 1. women obey men - contrary to hatred of arbitrary power of monarch over subjects/slave owners over slaves
  - 2. Enlightenment based on reason (innate in all people) - women have reason and are entitled to the same rights as men
- In terms of social class, who most benefited from the Enlightenment? Why? Who were most likely to oppose such a movement? Who was least affected by the Enlightenment?
  - aristocracy and upper middle class because the the spread of ideas was targeted to literate elite and they had salons
  - authorities/church because of conflicting beliefs and decreasing power
  - common people (peasants)

  - ran by women
  - coffeehouses, cafes, reading clubs, libraries
