- Describe daily life in the trenches
  - Daily life in the trenches was predictable. Thirty minutes before sunrise, troops had to “stand to,” ready to repl any attack. If no attack was forthcoming that day, the day routine consisted of breakfast followed by inspection, sentry duty, restoration of the trenches, care of personal items, or whiling away the times as best they could. Soldiers often recalled the bedroom of life in the dreary, lice-ridden, muddy or dusty trenches. At many places along the opposing lines of trenches, a “live and let live” system evolved based on the realization that neither side was going to drive out the other anyway. On both sides, troops produced their own humorous magazines. Battlefields were hellish landscapes of barbed wire, shell holes, mud, and injured and dying men. The introduction of prison gas in 1915 produced new forms of injuries. Soldiers in the trenches also lived with the president's presence of death.

  - Economic regimentation:
    - Since the war was expected to be short, little thoughts had been given to economic problems and long term wartime needs.

Wartime governments expanded their powers over their economics. Free market capitalist systems were temporarily shelved as governments Experimented with price, wage, and rent controls, the rationing of food supplies and materials, the regulation of imports and exports, and nationalization of transportation systems and industries.

By 1916, there were numerous signs that civilian morale was beginning to crack under the pressure of total war. The first two years of war witnessed only a few scattered strikes, but there after, strike activity increased dramatically. In 1916, 50,000 German workers carried out a three day work stoppage in Berlin to protest the arrest of a radical socialist leader. Internal opposition to the war came from two major sources in 1916 and 1917 liberals and socialists. Wartime Governments made active use of propaganda to arouse enthusiasm for the war.
  - Social Behaviors:
    - The withdrawal of millions of men from the labor market to fight, combined with the heightened demand for war time products, lead to jobs for everyone able to work. The cause of the labor Also benefited from the war. The enthusiastic patriotism of workers was soon rewarded with a greater acceptance of trade unions. World War I also created new rules for women. With so many men off fighting at the front, women were called on to take over jobs and responsibilities that had not been open to them before.
