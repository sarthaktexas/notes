- These are the first three industrial revolutions that transformed our modern society. With each of these three advancements
- the steam engine, the age of science and mass production, and the rise of digital technology
- the fundamental qualitative transformation of productive forces, based on the conversion of science into a leading factor in the development of social production.
- The Scientific Revolution was characterized by an emphasis on abstract reasoning, quantitative thought.

- up until the early 1970s Europe experienced what some called the "thirty glorious years" when on average life improved dramatically.
- People in Europe benefited from scientific and technological change.
- they weren't far removed from the hard times of World War Two and earlier of the Great Depression, so it was easy to feel the comparative improvement in quality of life.
- To many people things seemed pretty good, but at the same time students, workers and an array of activists were highly critical of the changes that had brought about a post-industrial.
- Society so Europe's thirty glorious years also saw lots of protests as people pointed out correctly. That injustice and structural inequality remained central features of human societies.

- A Culture of Protest
  - A Revolt in Sexual Mores

- A Divided Western World
  - Stagnation in the Soviet Union
    - Leonid Brezhnev became the head of the Communist Party after Khrushchev and issued the Brezhnev Doctrine, which said: any threat to socialist rule in any state of the Soviet bloc in Central and Eastern Europe was a threat to them all, and therefore justified the intervention of fellow socialist states.

    - In 1968 in Czechoslovakia Dubcek was elected as head of the Communist Party and introduced reforms in order to promote “Communism with a human face”. This period of euphoria became known as Prague Spring.
    - To prevent this movement from spreading, the USSR invaded Czechoslovakia and crushed the reform movement.

**[Skim pp. 914-917. Read “Popular Culture: Increasingly Global”]**
- What do you think “Globalization” is?
  - I think it is the interaction between several various people on a global scale. This process can be very beneficial to those who participate, but like many other things, has its fair share of cons as well. For instance, globalization has been criticized for being especially beneficial to corporations rather than working class citizens, but it really depends.

# Chapter 30: The Western World in a Global Age (p. 921)
- Toward a New Western Order
  - The Revolutionary Era in the Soviet Union
    - A new era began under Mikhail Gorbachev.
    - He noticed the USSR had fallen behind the West in technology, and that Soviets experienced a decline in the standard of living.
    - The cornerstone of his reforms was *perestroika*, “restructuring”. This included the beginnings of a market economy with some private property.
      - One of the most important instruments was *glasnost*, or “openness", in which Soviets were encouraged to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the USSR.
      - In 1988, Gorbachev called for the creation of the Congress of People’s Deputies, whose members were chosen in *competitive elections*.
      - He also created a new state presidency, and he became the first president of the USSR.
      - Ethnic groups throughout the USSR took advantage of glasnost and began to protest for more rights, which became difficult to control.
    - Gorbachev began to cooperate more closely with Boris Yeltsin, who had been elected president of the Russian republic in 1991.
    - In August 1991 a group of discontented conservative Soviet leaders arrested Gorbachev.
    - Soviet republics soon moved for independence, and Gorbachev resigned on Christmas Day 1991, turning his responsibilities over to Boris Yeltsin.
    - Why did the USSR collapse? A few theories include:
      - the ambitious defense policies adopted by the Reagan administration forced the Soviet Union into an arms race that it could not afford.
      - For years, Soviet leaders had denied or ignored the massive inefficiencies in the Soviet economy. In the 1980s, time began to run out. The perceptive Mikhail Gorbachev tried to stem the decline with radical reforms, but by then it was too late.
      - many of the minority nationalities were demanding more autonomy or even independence for their regions. By the end of the 1980s, such demands brought about the final collapse of the Soviet system.
    - Russia immediately transitioned to a free-market economy, but an increase in crime mobs and social disarray led to instability.
    - In 1999, Yeltsin was replaced by Vladimir Putin, who promoted a more assertive role in international affairs. While he often silenced his critics and controlled the media, many Russians see him as attempting to restore Russian pride and discipline.
  - Eastern Europe: The Revolutions of 1989 and the Collapse of the Communist Order
    - After Gorbachev made it clear that his government would not intervene militarily, Communist regimes fell in Eastern Europe in 1989.
    - Free elections in Poland allowed a Solidarity coalition to form a new gov’t, ending Communist rule. Lech Walesa became the new president.
    - In Czechoslovakia, the Communist government collapsed as a result of large demonstrations. President Va'clav Havel played a large role in this takedown of Communism, and began a goodwill tour of Western countries.
    - In Romania, dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was captured an executed after years of oppression against the Romanian people.

**[Skim pp. 925 (After the Fall) to 927 (Disintegration of Yugoslavia)]**
- When and why did the Berlin Wall come down?
  - On November 4th 1989, more than half a million people flooded the streets of East Berlin shouting, ‘‘The wall must go!’’ the German Communist government soon capitulated to popular pressure and on November 9 opened the entire border with the West. Hundreds of thousands of Germans swarmed across the border, mostly to visit and return. The Berlin Wall, long a symbol of the Cold War, became the site of massive celebrations as thousands of people used sledgehammers to tear it down.

- The Disintegration of Yugoslavia
  - Leader of the Serbian Communist Party, Slobadan Milosevic, rejected the separatism of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, and Macedonia. He demanded the creation of a Greater Serbia, which would affect the boundaries of those nations. When Croatia declared its independence, Serbian armies captured one-third of its territory.
  - By 1993, Serbia had acquired 70% of Bosnia’s territory, and their policy of ethnic cleansing, or killing or forcibly removing Bosnian Muslims from their lands, was similar to Nazi atrocities during WWII. NATO responded by airstrikes n Serbian military posts.
  - In 1993, some Albanians founded the Kosovo Liberation Army and began a campaign against Serbian rule.
  - Milosevic was put on trial for crimes against humanity and died in prison.

  - played a leading role in the affairs of the European Union
  - After new elections in 2009, she began a second term as Germany's chancellor and has led the EU nations in attempting to solve the financial problems of several EU members including Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal

- The Unification of Europe
  - On January 1, 1994 the European Community renamed itself the European Union (EU). In addition, the Maastricht Treaty represented an attempt to create a true economic and monetary union of all EC members by adopting a common currency, the Euro, by 1999.
  - The EU has a common agricultural policy, which provides aid to the EU’s poorest regions.
  - Some reasons people oppose the EU are:
    - The adoption of the Euro removed trade barriers, but the countries that use the Euro do not have a unified monetary policy.
    - The European Central Bank does not serve all nations equally, as the Governing Council and the Executive Board make decisions communally, and members tend to vote in favor of national interests instead of pro-European interests.
  - In order to join the EU, a candidate must show a commitment to capitalism, democracy, and respect minority and human rights.

**[Skim pp. 936-940]**

- Guest Workers and Immigrants
  - The population of Europe has increased over the last two decades due to mass migrations. Severe labor shortages encouraged them to rely on foreign workers. Most of these guest workers came from places that were formerly part of the British, French, Dutch, and Portuguese empires.
  - Some Europeans believed guest workers caused them to receive lower wages and benefits, and measures have been taken to restrict new immigration.
  - The National Front in France, led by Jean-Marie Le Pen and his daughter Marine Le Pen advocated restricting all new immigration.
  - Europe accepted 1.2 million refugees in 2015, mostly from the Middle East.
