# The Later Middle Ages: Crisis and Disintegration in the Fourteenth Century
Major events of the fourteenth century played a pivotal role in the disintegration of the three main pillars of medieval life.

## Crash Course
<ReactPlayer url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNCw2MOfnLQ" />

* Medieval Europe was famine-ridden.
* Bad things such as the Black Death, the Great Schism, the Hundred Years War, and the Little Ice Age happened in the 14th century.
* Bubonic Plague originated in Tibet and carried by rats and mice who hitched rides on humans.
* John Green can't juggle :\)
* Hundred Years War increased instability of food supply and the code of chivalry \(respect for others\) and was 116 years long.
* Technologies included the longbow and the cannon which helped England win.
* Joan of Arc helped Charles become King.
* Pope Boniface declared himself as the supreme leader after an argument about taxation between him and the king of France.
* Kings wanted tax money from Church to expand their administration and Boniface said no and threatened to excommunicate King Philip who then ordered the kidnapping of the pope. Boniface was tortured in captivity and died after he was released.
* Phillip wanted a French Pope and installed him in Avignon \(France\) and then Pope Gregory the who knows what number decided to move back to Rome but then he died. The Cardinals in Rome elected an Italian Pope \(Urban\) and then the French people were like who's leading the Papal Court in Avignon so they elected a French Pope so now there were 2 popes and a Schism occurred \(the Great Schism\).

### **A Time of Troubles: Black Death and Social Crisis**

* In the late 13th century \(1200s\), what weather event occurred and what was the effect it had upon the European population?
  * Europe entered a period known as the **"little ice age"** which shortened growing seasons and caused disastrous weather conditions such as severe storms and constant rain which led to **widespread famine and hunger.**
* By the turn of the 14th century \(1300s\), why wasn't Europe's population continuing to grow? Hint, think agriculture.
  * By 1300,  Europe had reached the upper limit in number of people because **all productive land was being farmed** including many marginal lands that needed intensive cultivation and proved easily susceptible to changing weather patterns.
* Explain the following: what the "black death" is, where the black death originated, who brought the black death westward, and how it spread to the Middle East before getting to Europe?
  * The **black death was a disaster pandemic** that struck Asia, North Africa, and Europe. It **originated in Asia** and haunted southwestern China until it was brought by rats accompanying **Mongol troops who spread the plague** into Central China and then into Northeastern China. When the Mongols rules the Eurasian landmass, the movement of people facilitated the spread of the plague into Samarkand, a trade stop on the **Silk Road. Then it arrived in Constantinople** in the Byzantine Empire and then spread slowly to other parts of the Middle East.
* Read the different accounts explaining the causes of the plague on p.301-302 and answer the following questions: What were the different explanations for the causes of the Black Death? How do you explain the differences, and what do these explanations tell you about the level of scientific knowledge in the Later Middle Ages?
  * Boccaccio said "some people \[thought\] that plenty of drinking and enjoyment, singing and free living and the gratification of the appetite in every possible way, **letting the devil take the hindmost**, was the best preventative."
    * "Letting the devil take the hindmost" most likely means they are enjoying the present and since they are having fun and drinking the devil won't bother them.
  * Others thought "no remedy against plagues was better than to leave them miles behind. Men and women without number... caring for nobody but themselves, **abandoned the city**, their houses, and estates... in search of a country place."
    * Yersinia Pestis would travel with the humans to their country place. This shows the level of scientific knowledge isn't accurate and isn't hindering on helping the people.
  * Some people thought "It is a matter of scientific fact that **earthquakes are cause**d by the exhalation of fumes enclosed in the bowls of the earth, \[and\] when the fumes batter against the sides of the earth cannot get out, the earth is shaken and moves and the corrupted air has been vented -- or ... purged."
    * It is not scientific fact that earthquakes are caused by the fumes of the earth and it shows the absurdity people go to to explain the Plague
  * Gigas states "the **Jews planned to wipe out all the Christians** with poison and had poisoned wells and springs everywhere."
    * This began the thought and movement of **anti-semitism** which is morally corrupt but was accepted at the time. This shows the societal beliefs in the Middle Ages.
* When it reached Europe in the mid-14th century, describe:
  * how it affected the population
    * It **decreased the population** and caused economic, social, and political problems such as anti-Semitism, irresponsible and incorrect beliefs, harsh movements, decreased property value, and higher wages.
  * the path it took through Europe \(hint: map on p303\)
    * The plague **entered Europe through Sicily** and went up through France and then Belgium and the Netherlands and then up to Scandinavia.
  * at least three different reactions people had to their imminent fear of death
    * **Jews want to kill the Christians** which the Pope didn't believe and didn't support that belief so he said no but the idea still existed.
    * **Earthquake is causing plague** because bad air is released from earth.
    * **Wrath of god** caused the Plague because humans did bad things and god wanted to fix it and teach humans a lesson.
* What is a flagellant, where were they found, and what did they believe?
  * **Popular in Germany**, **Flagellants flogged themselves with whips** **to win the forgiveness of god** whom they believed had sent the Plague to push humans for their sinful ways.
* What group did flagellants target? The flagellants conducted "pogroms" what are these?
  * **Flagellants targeted Jewish people** because they thought Jewish people were set out to poison the Christians and they blamed them for poisoning the wells. **Pogroms were the worst organized massacres of Jews** in Spain and the minority population were forced to flee to Russia and Poland where the King offered them protection.
* Read “The cremation of the Strasbourg Jews” on p.304. What charges were made against the Jews? Why do you think people blamed the Jews for the plague?
  * The Jews were **charged for causing the Plague** \_\_by putting poison in the water and the wells
  * People most likely blamed the Jews because in the **difference of religion** and because church and state were integrated, the council and magistrates also believed this.

### **Economic Dislocation and Social Upheaval**

* Society had been structured into three segments known as "estates" between 1000 and 1300, what were they?
  * The division of society into three estates of **clergy** \(those who pray\), **nobility** \(those who fight\), and **laborers** \(those who work\)
* How did the change in population during the 1300s affect the economy for landlords and peasants, particularly in England \(p.312-313\)?
  * Landlords were **forced to pay more for labor**ers while the **value of their property went down**. Because of this their **income went down** and they experienced considerable **lower standards of living**.
* What was the "Jacquerie" - why was the French peasantry so upset and angry?
  * Jacquerie was a **peasant revolt** in northern France. 
  * The **destruction of normal order** and subsequent **economic dislocation from the Black Plague** as well as **ravages created by the Hundred Years' War** which affected French peasantry were factors in causing the Jacquerie.
* How did peasant revolts typically end? Were they generally effective or ineffective for long-term change?
  * Outburst of peasant anger led to savage confrontations and Castles were burned and nobles murdered. 
  * Peasant revolts usually **ended when the privileged classes closed ranks, savagely massacred the rebels**, and ended the revolt.
  * While peasant revolts were effective for short-term gains, the **uprisings were quickly crushed and their gains lost**. Nevertheless, the revolts ushered in an age of social conflict.

### **War and Political Instability**

* Briefly summarize in a few sentences, and in your own words, what caused the tensions between England and France to heighten over time - eventually resulting in the breakout of the Hundred Years' War.
  * **Disagreements over rights to land, economic conflicts, and a dispute over the succession of the French throne.** The king wanted to pass it nicely to a male heir, but France didn't have a male heir to pass it to because King Charles IV died without children. This made King Philip VI escalate a dispute over feudal rights in Gascony to a battle for the French Crown.
* In the early part of the Hundred Years' War, the English were successful in which two major battles? The second of these battles resulted in a temporary peace treaty called what? What weapon did the English use in these battles?
  * The English shot **longbows** and ended in a stunning victory in the **Battle of Crécy**. When the French had to fight again, the French were also defeated in the **Battle of Poitiers**. This resulted in the **Treaty of Brétigny** which was never really enforced.
* In 1415, the war continued - what happened at the Battle of Agincourt?
  * In the Battle of Agincourt, the **French suffered a disastrous defeat**. 6000 French men died and only 300 English men died.
* What role in Joan of Arc play beginning in 1429? How did her role in the Hundred Years' War come to an end?
  * Joan of Arc persuaded Charles to allow her to accompany a French army to Orléans. The French army found new confidence after being inspired by her and changed the course of the war. France kept liberating English-occupied areas. Joan had **brought the war to a decisive turning point.** Her role came to an end when she was captured by the Burgundian allies of the English captured her and wishing to eliminate her, **the English turned Joan over to the Inquisition and charged her with witchcraft and burned her at the stake** at the age of 19. 25 years later, she was exonerated of the charges and in 1920, made a saint of the Roman Catholic Church. 
* Which side won the 100 Years War? What new technology helped them gain the upper hand?
  * Although, the war dragged on for another two decades, defeats of English armies ultimately led to **French victory**. Important to the French success was the use of the cannon, a new weapon made possible by the **invention of the cannon** from the Chinese invention of gunpowder. The Chinese had created a simple cannon which the Mongols greatly improved which then spread to the Middle East and then to Europe.
* Explain why European governments faced so much political instability after the Hundred Years' War.
  * Reigning monarchs in Europe were no longer direct descendants of the rulers of 1300. As a result, **they struggled to gain a position** in the factions of nobles. At the start of the fifteenth century, there were multiple claimants to thrones. Older monarchs also faced financial problems as well. Their **income proved insufficient** to meet their needs and they tried to get new sources of revenue but ultimately failed.
* What is a "parliamentary body," otherwise simply known as a "parliament," and how did they become more prominent in England during this era? What two houses comprise the English Parliament?
  * A parliament is a **legislative body**. They became more prominent when **monarchs wanted money** because they were forced to go through parliaments. The English Parliament consists of the **House of Lords and the House of Commons**.
* Why was a monarchy so difficult to effectively rule in France? In what ways might France NOT have been considered to have as much unity as England?
  * The monarchy had **much of its wealth dissipated** and **rival factions of aristocrats** had made effective monarchical rule virtually impossible. The French **parliament**, known as the Estates-General and composed of representatives of the clergy, the nobility, and the Third Estate \(everyone else\) **only existed in the North**. **Southern France had their own estates**, and local estates existed in other parts of France.
* What is a "taille gabelle" and how did French peasants feel about it?
  * **Taille is the hearth tax** put by Philip VI and **gabelle is the salt tax.** These were made so the King could get more wealth. The French **peasants did not like it** and tried to use the Estates-General to reform the French government and tax structure.
* Modern day European borders and nations are very different from the 14th century. The lands that, today, are mostly called "Germany" were a collection of hundreds of monarchies \(some large, others very small\) known as what? How was it determined who ruled over the kings across this territory?
  * The collection of hundreds of monarchies in present-day Germany area was called the Holy Roman Empire which was already starting to fall apart. It then became **the German Monarchy** after the Hohenstaufen failed to unite their lands and everyone become their own princely states. Although all the rulers had an obligation to the German King and the Holy Roman Emperor, they became more and more independent. The German Monarchy was established on a **elective basis**, not hereditary. The Golden Bull issued by Charles IV states the **4 lay princes and 3 ecclesiastical rulers would elect** the "king of the Romans and future emperor, to be ruler of the world and of the Christian people." "King of the Romans" was the official title of the German King and would also have the title of emperor. Later, the electoral principle made sure the kings of Germany were weak. Three emperors claimed the throne in the 15th century but while that was quickly settled, the 15th century of Germany was verged on anarchy. Princes fought each other and leagues of cities. The emperors were virtually powerless to control any of them.
* Explain in a sentence or two why Italy was not considered a single, unified, centrally-governed territory?
  * **Papal opposition** to Hohenstaufen emperors guaranteed a centralized monarchy would fail in Italy. The **larger**, regional **states** would often **conquer the smaller ones**. The idea of a unified, centrally-governed territory was also impossible as **tyrants tried to legitimize their power** by purchasing titles such as the Duke of Milan and the Duke of Ferrara. Each state was in **battle with one-another** and by the end of the 14th century, there were 3 major states, Milan, Florence, and Venice.
* What two trends does the book say you should know about Italy during the 14th century?
  * The replacement of republican governments by tyrants \(**despotism**\)
  * The **expansion of the larger city-states into smaller ones** =&gt; creates 3 major dominant states
* Name some of the more powerful states of Italy in the 14th century.
  * the despotic state of **Milan**
  * the republican states of **Florence** and **Venice**

### **The Cultural World of the Fourteenth Century**

* Prior to the 14th century, almost anything that was written in Europe was written in Latin, even though it was no longer the spoken language. What is vernacular? Name some authors who helped to expand the practice of writing in vernacular. What were some examples of their works?
  * **Vernacular** is the native language that everyone speaks.

| Writer | Name of Works | Significance of Works and/or the Writer's Message |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Dante Alighieri | _Divine Comedy_ | **the story of soul's progression to salvation**  - Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso =&gt; ends up where Dante gets turned over to the Virgin Mary, since grace is necessary to achieve the final step of entering the presence of God, where one beholds "the love that moves the sun and the other stars" |
| Francesco Petrarca | Petrarchan Sonnets | Petrarch's sonnets were inspired by his love for a married lady. Important because he **analyzes every aspect of the unrequited lover's feelings**. This reveals a **sense of individuality** stronger than in any previous medieval literature. |
| Giovanni Boccaccio | _Decameron_ | Set at the time of the Black Death, ten young people flee to a villa outside Florence to escape the plague and decide to pass the time by telling stories. He presents the society of his time from a **secular point of view**. It is the **seducer of women who is the real hero**. |
| Geoffrey Chaucer | _Canterbury Tales_ | A collection of stories told by a group of twenty-nine pilgrims journeying from the London suburb of Southwark to the tomb of Saint Thomas à Becket at Canterbury. This format gave Chaucer the chance to **portray an entire range of English society** from Knights to the Plow-man. He also **used some of his characters satirically to criticize** the corruption of the church in the late medieval period. He particularly **disdains the corrupt practices of clerics**. Yet Chaucer was still a Christian. |
| Christine De Pizan | _The Book of the City of Ladies_ | Her work was known for French prose works written in **defense of women**. She denounced that the many male writers who had argued that women needed to be controlled by men because women by their very nature were prone to evil, unable to lear, and easily  swayed. Her work **helped refute anti-feminist attacks**. |

* Giotto is considered the forerunner of the Italian Renaissance. In what ways \(name 3\) was his art very different from other art being created during his time? Where was his work performed?
  * His **figures were solid and rounded**; **placed realistically** in relationship to each other and their background
  * they conveyed **three-dimensional depth**
  * the **expressive faces and physically realistic bodies** have his sacred figures **human qualities** with which spectators could identify
* How did the Black Death affect art?
  * There was a **large body of morbid work** inspired by the Black Death and the recurrences of the plague.

### **Society in an Age of Adversity**

* Explain how life in urban areas changed after the Black Death.
  * Town governments **regulated urban activities more** and authorities **tried to keep cities cleaner** by enacting new ordinances against waste products in the street.
  * **Bathhouses** were looked at as unhealthy so they were **closed down** which lead to a decline in personal cleanliness.
  * Cities intensified their regulation of prostitution \(**Prostitution increased**\)
* How did gender roles change after the plague? What effects did this have on women? \(Consider the “Legal Rights of Women” on p.335\)
  * Women were running businesses but were viewed as **incapable of undertaking all of men's activities**. There was a division of labor roles between men and women that persisted until the Industrial Revolution.
  * In practice, women worked as **metal workers, stevedores, clothmaking/weaving, and brewing**. Brewin became an all-female profession.
* Describe the way the average middle- or upper-class child was raised in the late middle ages.
  * **Boys were taught a trade as soon as possible**. Those who early become and long remain apprentices ought to be the best masters. Some **cities provided schools to educate the young**. Both girls and boys attended these schools but boys went on to secondary school after primary grammar school.
* Explain some fundamental flaws in the understanding of medicine according to what was believed by clergymen and "physicians" living in the 14th c. What was the general hierarchy of people who practiced any kind of medicine in those times?
  * **There were four humors that represented the 4 different elements.** 
  * The hierarchy was **physicians** who learned from prestigious medical schools. Below them were **surgeons** who performed operations, set broken bones, and bleeding patients. Their knowledge was based on practical experience. Below them were **midwives** who delivered babies. And below them were **barber-surgeons** who cut hair and pulled teeth as a supplement to their income.
* According to Spielvogel, what was the most extraordinary invention of the 14th century? WHY?
  * The most extraordinary invention was **the clock**. It made a visible impact on European cities. They revolutionized how people thought about and used time. Originally, time was determined by natural rhythms or church bells corresponding to the ecclesiastical offices of the church. **Clocks made it possible for people to plan their day and organize activities around the regular striking of bells.**
* What were two other important inventions of the 13th and 14th centuries? What makes them significant?
  * The other two inventions were **eyeglasses and paper**. The high cost of paper made people write in small handwriting. **Eyeglasses made it easier to read this small text**. At the same time, **paper was made cheaper** because it was made from cotton rags.

## Short Answer Practice

#### Make an argument either for or against the idea that climate and disease played a major role in producing social, economic, and political changes in the fourteenth century.

Climate and disease played a major role in producing social, economic, and political changes in the fourteenth century. The "little ice age" in Europe caused famine and hunger. Disease such as the Black Death caused the population in Europe to grind to a halt and even decrease. The disease also caused the Flagellants movement to become more popular which caused the Catholic Church \(which was integrated with the state\) to condemn them because of their anti-semitic beliefs. During the Black Death, peasant workers who were paid very little suddenly had an increase in salary while produce prices fell drastically. Landlords had to pay more for labor and lose value in their property which made aristocrats want to lower the wage rate.
