    - the working classes: Trade unions and the labor party were forcing liberals to adopt to significant social reforms. they wanted more radical changes for the economic system since the government wasn't helping start these reforms. a movement of laborers emerged among a group of intellectuals known as the Fabian Socialists who stressed the need for the workers to use their rights to vote to capture the House of Commons and pass legislation hat would benefit the laboring class. these groups weren't Marxist. favored evolution toward a socialist state by democratic means. The liberals that gained control over the House of Commons in that year held the government from 1906- 1914, thought they would enact a social welfare program or lose the support of the workers. The National Insurance Act of 1911 provided benefits for workers in case of sickness and unemployment to be paid for by the compulsory contributions from workers, employers, and the state.
  - Italy
    - liberals had problems in italy, a certain amount of stability was achieved when the liberal leader, Giovanni Gioletti served intermittently as prime minister and was the master of transformation, a system in which old political groups were transformed into new gov. coalitions, by political and economical bribery. However, his devious effects in the long term, made Italy corrupt and unmanageable. When urban workers turned to violence to protest their living ad working conditions, Giolitti tried to appease them with Social welfare legislation and universal male suffrage to make him look good but it really didn't do much.
  - France
    - evidence of renewed anti-semitism in europe. Alfred Drefus a jew was accused for selling secrets and condemned to death. Evidence emerged for his innocence. Another catholic officer who was more obviously a traitor, but didn't need to have a trial. Some right-winged journalists even used the case to push their own anti-semitism views. After a wave of intense public outrage, the republic's leader's insisted on another trial. also he trail failed to set aside the guilty verdict, the government pardoned Dreyfus and he was fully exonerated. Moderate republicans lost control to radical republicans who were determined to make greater progress toward a more democratic society by breaking the power of the Republican's enemies., especially the army of the catholic church. The church and state were officially separated in 1905 and during the next tow years, te government seized church property and stopped paying clerical salaries. As a small nation, france lagged far behind great Britain, germany, and the united states in industrial activity. Moreover, after the industrialization france realized it had done little to help the working class members and their discontent. The french parliament felt pressured to enact labor legislation. This made strikes more appealing to the working class.
  - Germany
    - Germany had become the strongest military and industrial power on the Continent. New social configurations had emerged. THe growth f expansion led to even greater expansion for the Social Democratic Party. William II was no more successful at slowing the growth of Social Democrats. It had become the largest single party int eh Reichstag. Its growth frightened the middle and upper classes who blamed labor for their own problems. Conservatives especially landowning nobility and representatives of heavy industry (two of the powerful ruling groups in Germany), tried to block it by supporting William II's activist foreign policy. German society had problems between modernization and keeping old traditions that was manifested in a new, radicalized right-winged politics.
  - Austria-Hungary (be sure to mention Nationalism, and the creation of a Dual Monarchy and the effects those had)
    - had problems with having numerous nationalities. the granting of universal male suffrage in 1907. As Austria industrialized, two working class parties came to existence both strongly influenced by nationalism. The social Democrats were marxists, and the Christian Socialists who were more nationalist and anti-semitic. While subjugating their nationalities, the ruling Magyars in Hungary developed a movement for complete separation from Austria. When they demanded the hungarian army be separated from the imperial army, Emperor Francis Joseph as King of Hungary acted forcefully and threatened to impose universal male suffrage on Hungary a move that would challenge Magyar domination of the minorities. Kept and maintained the Dual Monarchy because Hungarian leaders fell in line with the parliamentary leader.
  - Russia (Be sure to mention the Revolution of 1905, Sergei Witte, Peter Stolypin, and socialism)
    - Whitte's program made possible the rapid growth of a modern steel and coal industry in Ukraine. so the result with mass industrialization was oppressed people and more socialist parties. With industrialization came factories an industrial working class, industrial suburbs around Saint Petersburg and Moscow, and pitiful working conditions. Socialist thought and socialist parties developed although Russia soon force them to go underground to become revolutionary. Nicholas II made it very autocratic oppressed socialist groups. The Marxist Social Democratic Party held its first congress in Minsk in 1898 but the arrest of its leaders cause the next one to be in Brussels in 1903. The growing opposition of the Tsarist regime exploded in the revolution of 1905, because before, the Social Revolutionaries worked to overthrow the Tsarist autocracy and establish peasant socialism, having no other outlet they advocated for political terrorism.
